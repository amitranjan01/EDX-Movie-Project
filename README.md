# Movie_Recommendations_EDX
Repository for final project in the Introduction to Data Science Course from HarvardX on EdX

This project is realized in the context of HarvardX -  PH125.9x Data Science Capstone, the final course of the HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science.

For this project, I will be creating a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. The version of movielens included in the dslabs package 
(which was used for some of the exercises in PH125.8x: Data Science: Machine Learning) is just a small subset of a much larger dataset with millions of ratings. 

I will be creating my own recommendation system using all the tools we have shown you throughout the HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science program. 

We will use the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset to make the computation a little easier.
